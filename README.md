## Bitbuy, Canadian platform to buy and sell Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.

### Overview and Origin
<hr
    
Bitbuy, a Canadian owned and operated cryptocurrency company based out of Toronto, Ontario, was originally launched in 2013 under the name of InstaBT.com by Jordan Anderson and Adam Goldman. Bitbuy Technologies Inc was established and incorporated on February 1, 2016. Their mission is “to provide fellow Canadians convenient, dependable, and secure access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies” (Bitbuy.ca). New and experienced users can easily buy, sell, and hold multiple digital currencies through a simple interface designed to make trading an easy process. The Express Trade Platform is specifically for those who are new to cryptocurrency and trading and the Pro Trade platform is for advanced and expert traders. Currently Bitbuy offers the following 15 crypto currencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, Stellar Lumens, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, AAVE, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Polygon, and Solana. According to their website bitbuy.ca they are “Canada’s most secure and trusted platform for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)”. 
    
Based on a podcast in 2018 with founder Adam Goldman, known as a cryptocurrency influencer, he discussed how the company came to be. He stated that in 2014, he recognized that cryptocurrency and specifically Bitcoin, the first blockchain, was a disruptive technology to the field of finance. “It provided a new way of exchanging value on the internet and another method of payment as a new currency” (Adam Goldman 2018). Adam then started looking at the ups and downs of this new industry and began researching businesses within this new field. In 2015 when bitcoin was trading at $200 -$300 per coin, he came up with the idea for this business model and had several partners and backers along the way. By 2018 Bitbuy was on its way to being a top fintech company and on October 25, 2018, acquired CBIX (Canada’s bitcoin index). 
    
The company has three investors listed on crunchbase.com; Robert Halpern was a seed round contributor, and Murray Goldman another seed round contributor provided $1.7 million CAD on April 1, 2019. The last recorded funding type was corporate funding by WonderFi Technologies on December 3, 2021. On January 4, 2022, WonderFi Technologies bought Bitbuy’s parent company, First Ledger Corporation for $206 million CAD (in cash and stocks). 
    
### Business Activities and Landscape
<hr

FinTech is changing the face of financial services as we know them to be. For example, over the last 10 years we have seen a steady increase in online and mobile technology being used for personal banking and investing. You no longer need to go into a physical bank to make payments, deposit cheques or transfer funds. These and other services like managing your investments, buying, and selling stocks can all be done through an app on your phone. Mobile wallets and digital currency are also on the rise. More and more cryptocurrencies are becoming available, and there is a steady increase in the number of individuals buying and selling them. However, one needs to be cautious as they are not all legitimate. 

Companies and organizations like PayPal and Starbucks are now accepting bitcoin and other digital currencies as payments (smallbiztrends.com).  This is allowing individuals to have more control over their finances and relying less on traditional banks. Terms such as “banking the unbanked” has been linked to this trend. With increase access to mobile financing and cryptocurrency those who did not have access to traditional banking services can now become their own banks through FinTech companies that are emerging. We are already seeing a global usage and interest in countries where banks and local currency are unstable. Canada’s adaption rate is on the slower but steady side with yearly increases on the number of users and new start up fintech companies. There is a positive correlation between increased public knowledge and users. As more knowledge is becoming available, as can be seen on tv, social media and other outlets of advertising, the number of users is also increasing. 

Even though investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still considered to be risky, unstable, and unregulated, requiring standardization, the trend seems to be that cryptocurrency and blockchain will become the standard for the future world infrastructure. Especially as it relates to security as complex mathematics is used to protect information and exchanges. According to woobull.com, it is estimated that today’s children will live in an adult world where everyone uses bitcoin since bitcoin users is following a pattern of doubling every 12 months. The once skeptical bitcoin customer is now looking for opportunities to invest. The goal of Bitbuy is to make holding and trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assessable to everyone, from the novice to the expert, the tech savvy to the not so tech savvy. They provide a user friendly and mobile friendly interface with educational resources and an online customer service portal. In addition, they have advanced quoting features and charting capabilities. They currently have 375 000 users with over $4 billion dollars traded to date, 1000 corporate clients and provide 7-days a week service with a dedicated account manager  (reuters.com).
